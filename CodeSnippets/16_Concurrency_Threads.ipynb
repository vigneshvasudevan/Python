    "Simply put, it’s doing multiple things at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need concurrency?\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency can make a big difference for two types of problems. \n",
    "These are generally called CPU-bound and I/O-bound.\n",
    "I/O-bound problems cause your program to slow down because it frequently must \n",
    "wait for input/output (I/O) from some external resource. \n",
    "They arise frequently when your program is working with things that are much \n",
    "slower than your CPU.\n",

    "How can we achieve concurrency inside python?\n",
    "    1. Threading\n",
