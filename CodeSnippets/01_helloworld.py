How to run your first python program?

1. Install VS(Visual studio) code or any editor or IDE of your preference. 
    For vs code : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

    What's an IDE ? 
        IDE = Integrated Development Environment, It has 3 components
        1. Editor e.g) Notepad, Notepad++, Microsoft word where we write code
        2. Compiler/interpreter -> To run the program
        3. Debugger -> To debug the program
        

2. Install python from https://www.python.org

3. Add python to system environment variables

    For windows: 
        1. Copy the path where you have installed python, itâ€™s usually
            C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310
            C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts
        
    
        2. Open System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or 
        use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)
        
        3. Click Advanced system settings in the sidebar.
        4. Click Environment Variables...
        5. Select PATH in the System variables section
        6. Click Edit
        7. Add Python's path to the end of the list (the paths are separated by semicolons).

    On completing this, open the command prompt on the Windows and run below command
        python --version
    
    sample output for the above command is: Python 3.8.9
